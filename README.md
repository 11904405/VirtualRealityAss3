Gameplay:

If you are ready, you press the button ready to start and if all players have pressed it a start text appears and you move back to the start position.
If you want to reset the game, you press reset game in the hand UI. Reseting it resets it for every player involved in the room.
A room can contain up to 4 players.
You move forward by moving the left hand controller up and down. The controller should be moved up and down from an almost hanging position to a slightly angled position (similar to walking, which means you can either walk or only use the left controller for movement). The player starts out with a slower movement and gets faster if they move their controller at a certain speed until a threshhold is reached (if they do not move it fast enough then the speed decline can happen faster/similarly fast and they slowly get slower again). The player has to do an up down (or down up) movement in a certain time frame to start moving (so that no accidental movement occurs if the person only moves their hand up or down).
You win if you are the first person to arrive at the finish mushrooms.
